## TL;DR

- Congress enacted the Science and Engineering to Comprehensively Understand and Responsibly Enhance (SECURE) Water Act in March 2009
- Part of the National Water Census (NWC)
- Department of Interior called WaterSMART (Sustain and Manage Americaâ€™s Resources for Tomorrow).
- Senay and his ET modeling is a better understanding of how much of the rainfall ends up evaporating or transpiring into the air.
- Senay uses remotely sensed data scaled to Landsat 30-meter resolution and energy-balance principles to model the rates of evaporation and transpiration on fields in the upper basin. 
	- In the modeling of moisture allocation, plants are allowed to take precedence first.
	- So understanding how much of that water is used by plants is key
	- An important plant use model is -->  the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model

Again, this shows that the SSEBop is a viable approach that can produce reliable results with minimal effort, in near real-time as soon as the __Ts__ data are available with an automatic processing and posting.
