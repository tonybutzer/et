## TL;DR

- Congress enacted the Science and Engineering to Comprehensively Understand and Responsibly Enhance (SECURE) Water Act in March 2009
- Part of the National Water Census (NWC)
- Department of Interior called WaterSMART (Sustain and Manage Americaâ€™s Resources for Tomorrow).
- Senay and his ET modeling is a better understanding of how much of the rainfall ends up evaporating or transpiring into the air.
- Senay uses remotely sensed data scaled to Landsat 30-meter resolution and energy-balance principles to model the rates of evaporation and transpiration on fields in the upper basin. 
	- In the modeling of moisture allocation, plants are allowed to take precedence first.
	- So understanding how much of that water is used by plants is key
	- An important plant use model is -->  the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model

Again, this shows that the SSEBop is a viable approach that can produce reliable results with minimal effort, in near real-time as soon as the __Ts__ data are available with an automatic processing and posting.

> Phenology is the study of the timing of recurring biological
cycles and their connection to climate (White and Thomton
1997; White et al. 2009). It can influence the exchange of
energy, water vapor, and momentum between the land surface
and the atmosphere and, therefore, is critical to understand the
global carbon and water cycles (Cong et al. 2013). Changes in
phenology also affect the abundance and distribution of spe-
cies (Enquist et al. 2014). In turn, changes in the timing of
vegetation phenology are widely considered to be one of the
most sensitive biological responses to climate change and an
excellent predictor of changes already underway (IPCC
2013). An earlier occurrence of spring phenology, which
closely correlates with rising temperatures, has been observed...
