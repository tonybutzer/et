# Sandbox

## Prototyping Phase

### Goals/Characteristics

1. Must allow nonUSGS Collaboration
2. Be affordable
3. Be Easy to use
4. Allow access to data bucket `ga-et-data`
5. Easy to slurp/clone github repos
	- VegET repo here

## USER TL;DR

1. THE IP is xx.xx.xx.xx
2. login with your last name
3. YOU SET THE PASSWORD THE FIRST TIME - so jot it down
4. Building your notebook ecosystem:
	- make -f files/Makefile git
	- make -f files/Makefile lunch-lib
5. Tony is the admin dude for this - he can reset this or do a master restart


### Technical Stack

1. uses TLJH - fairly nice for this purpose
