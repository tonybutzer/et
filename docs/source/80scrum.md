# SCRUM - running

## WIP

### Feb 28, 2020 - meet with Steffi

1. Document Steffi Actions
	- probaly focus on understanding the data assets in the cloud
		- the vsis3 stuff
	- explore visualizing the data
	- longer term seek out ways to just ise data lakes
	- with Landsat C2 maybe use NDVI scalled to 250 meters via ODC scaling 
	- help me understand all this data summing and interpolation - or just keep you and darin involved in that part of the project.
	- do we have code that runs on a pc with no GEE libraries - could lift and shift and modify that code?
2. Tony
	- any benefit in mapping MODIS NDVI into xarrays - maybe even using ODC middleware?

### Feb 27, 2020

1. Standing up Jupyter Hub in Aussie Account
2. Started looking at the VegET code
	- a little concerned about how different GEE is to rasterio/xarray
3. Data Loading
	- still loading the MODIS data
	- bucket renamed to `ga-et-data`
4. Data Discovery - started some notes here
	[LPDAAC DATA WOW CLICK HERE:](http://44.226.205.97/33data_discovery.html#lpdaac)
5. More to Come
6. Tony should get better at packaging python pip/conda inside a venv with tljh - I know right?
