# Technical Status

## WIP Focus Areas
1. Project Initiation - Project Charter
2. Synergies between LandFire and ET
3. Foundation Infrastructure
	- Project Website with DNS Record - DONE
		- initial ip is **44.226.205.97**
		- ```dynamic dns``` is et.hopto.org
	- ```dump tljh```TLJH inside CHS with OpenDataCube Functioning- document why
		- pangeo.chs offers an outsourced solution for simple jupyter play - frees Tony
		- tljh not easiliy integrated with ODC
		- tljh not a docker approach - development philosophy should mandate docker
4. Proxy Data Lake as an ODC Indexed Product (c1l2scenealbers)
5. Simple Sample Jupyter Notebooks - Kagone plus others
6. Gap analysis technical shortfall analysis of pangeo.chs.usgs.gov as an OpenDataCube platform

## Tactical Successes
1. Meetings between technologists and scientists happening
2. Stood up a ET in the cloud website
	- http://et.hopto.org

## Technical Challenges
1. Data Loading
2. Defining the Index Strategy
3. Collection-2 not yet available
4. Loading non-Landsat complementary data


# High Level Status

## Successes

1. Established a PANGEO Project corresponding reference architecture with community and ESIP free and open Pangeo environments and example instances in Google Cloud, AWS and HPC centers.
2. USGS and GeoScience Australia hosting a number of training workshops to promote direct access to the Analysis Ready Data and teleport the Scientist directly adjacent to the data. Basically eliminating the need to transfer and store local copies of the data. 
3. Mature robust cloud capabilities with 100% uptime.
	- Elastic infrastructures that are cost efficient and scale dramatically to solve problems that are "Embarrassingly Parallel"
	- DCOI friendly approach

## Challenges

1. Pace and Frequency of Change
	- Python Libraries
	- Growth in the number of EO Satellites and Sensors
	- Cloud Services
	- Growth and change in architectural choices
2. Reduce the amount of data curation and technology deployment burdens to perform pure Science
	- Unburden the scientist
3. Collaboration among USGS peers in open source venues
	- Approvals and acceptance of these models is still under debate.
4. The technologist knows technology - the scientist knows science - how do we efficiently communicate
	- How to partition the tasks into technical steps
