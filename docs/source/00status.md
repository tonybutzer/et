# Technical Status

## Successes

1. Established a PANGEO Project corresponding reference architecture with community and ESIP free and open Pangeo environments and example instances in Google Cloud, AWS and HPC centers.
2. USGS and GeoScience Australia hosting a number of training workshops to promote direct access to the Analysis Ready Data and teleport the Scientist directly adjacent to the data. Basically eliminating the need to transfer and store local copies of the data. 
3. Mature robust cloud capabilities with 100% uptime.
	- Elastic infrastructures that are cost efficient and scale dramatically to solve problems that are "Embarrassingly Parallel"

## Challenges

1. Pace and Frequency of Change
	- Python Libraries
	- Growth in the number of EO Satellites and Sensors
	- Cloud Services
	- Growth and change in architectural choices
2. Reduce the amount of data curation and technology deployment burdens to perform pure Science
	- Unburden the scientist
3. Collaboration among USGS peers in open source venues
	- Approvals and acceptance of these models is still under debate.
4. The technologist knows technology - the scientist knows science - how do we efficiently communicate
	- How to partition the tasks into technical steps
